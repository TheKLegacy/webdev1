                        We pride ourselves on the personal touch and outstanding cuts of meat, seafood, chops and feature a cigar friendly outdoor covered patio. Service and quality are the name of the game and we take our relationships in the community seriously.  Reservations are strongly encouraged.

                        Just as the chefs carefully source each ingredient, every element of the space, from the locally crafted banquettes to the modern china, has also been thoughtfully selected to enhance the entire dining experience.

                        Creating an aesthetic that mirrors the food and service philosophies of a restaurant is, quite simply, an art and must incorporate the neighborhood, the architecture of the building and the vision of the chef.
